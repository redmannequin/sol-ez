# Sol-Ez
Sol-Ez is a Solana contract framework designed to generate template code and simplify the process of writing Solana programs.

## Why Sol-Ez?
- Reduces Boilerplate: Automatically generates necessary Rust structures.
- Improves Readability: Enforces a structured definition of contracts.
- Simplifies Development: Manage accounts with a simple API.

## Getting Started
- Define your accounts and instructions using the Sol-Ez toml config.
- Use the Sol-Ez code generator to produce the Rust contract.
- Implement your business logic by defining a contract struct and implementing the generated trait.

## Examples
The [`examples/`](./examples) folder contains sample Solana programs built using this framework. These are intended to showcase how to structure and use the framework.
